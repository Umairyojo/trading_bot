# Binance Futures Trading Bot

## Overview

This project is a Python 3.11+ command-line trading bot for Binance Futures Testnet (USDT-M). It supports authenticated market and limit orders, request validation, structured logging, and clean terminal output.

## Architecture

- `cli.py` handles argument parsing, validation, and terminal output.
- `bot/config.py` loads environment variables and validates credentials.
- `bot/validators.py` normalizes and validates user input.
- `bot/client.py` wraps the authenticated Binance Futures client.
- `bot/orders.py` places orders and formats API responses.
- `bot/logging_config.py` configures rotating application logs.

## Installation

### Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a local `.env` file in the project root using `.env.example` as the template:

```env
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BINANCE_TESTNET_BASE_URL=https://testnet.binancefuture.com
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE=logs/trading_bot.log
```

## Running Examples

### Market Order Example

```bash
python cli.py --symbol BTCUSDT --side BUY --type MARKET --quantity 0.001
```

### Limit Order Example

```bash
python cli.py --symbol BTCUSDT --side SELL --type LIMIT --quantity 0.001 --price 108000
```

## Logs

Application logs are written to `logs/trading_bot.log` using a rotating file handler. Logs include request details, responses, API failures, network errors, and unexpected exceptions.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure `.env` exists and contains valid Binance Futures Testnet credentials.
- Confirm `BINANCE_API_KEY` and `BINANCE_SECRET_KEY` are set and not blank.
- Use uppercase symbols such as `BTCUSDT`.
- `LIMIT` orders require `--price`.
- Verify the Binance Futures Testnet endpoint if connectivity errors occur.

## Problems Faced

While building this project, a few small issues came up:

- I first had to make sure the bot could read values from `.env` without exposing secrets in the code. I solved this by loading everything through a config module and keeping credentials out of the source files.
- Input handling needed to be strict but still friendly. I solved this by adding validation for symbol, side, order type, quantity, and price, so users get clear error messages instead of cryptic failures.
- Binance API responses were not always easy to present cleanly in the terminal. I handled this by formatting the response into a simple order summary before printing it.
- Logging had to stay useful without becoming messy. I solved this by using a rotating log file so the app keeps a proper history without creating huge log files.

## Assumptions

- Binance Futures Testnet is used only for order submission and connectivity checks.
- Market orders do not require a price.
- Limit orders require a positive price.
- Logging is stored locally and not shipped to an external observability system.
